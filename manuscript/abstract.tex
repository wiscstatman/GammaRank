The problem addressed is how to efficiently calculate the probability
that independent but differently distributed normal or gamma random variables appear in a particular rank order.  
The computation arises in Bayesian inference when the underlying parameters are subject to ordering constraints.
We show a case from the analysis of preference ordering and another case **clustering**.
Constraints may also appear in the sample space, and then the computation may be required to evaluate the sampling
probability of some event, as for example occurs in the evaluation of rank likelihood **or **.
We confirm that the normal-rank probability is the 
limit of a series of gamma-rank probabilities.   Using a compact 
 formula for gamma-rank probabilities, we also show 
how a dynamic programming algorithm enables efficient numerical evaluation. 
**beyond ranks to up/down constraints**
